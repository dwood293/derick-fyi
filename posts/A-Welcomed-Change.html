                <p>11-02-2025</p>
                <p>I have a major problem with the internet.</p>
                <p>It has become a nightmare to use. As a kid, the internet was fun.
                    It was a place to go; chat with your friends; learn something new. Discoveries to be made.</p>
                <p>Remember when we used to tell our friends "G2G - I'm logging off now!"
                    When was the last time you logged off? These days, the algorithms, feeds and endless scrolling
                    leave me mentally and emotionally fatigued, full of despair. I'm over it.</p>
                <p>It's time for something new. Time to make the internet a joy again.</p>
                <p>Welcome to my website; my digital garden. A living archive for my life, my hobbies,
                    musings, family recipes, fleeting interests, and whatever else is happening with me.
                    For things and people that bring me joy.</p>
                <p>No feeds, no ads, no algorithms, no tracking. Just like it used to be.</p>
                <h2>I have a few goals for this site:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Archive my life. </li>
                    <li>Create a better relationship with the internet.</li>
                    <li>Create, learn, and showcase my various makings & doings.
                        (Old-school web development offers a surprisingly satisfying creative medium.)</li>
                    <li>Reverse the decline of my attention span.</li>
                    <li>Connect with others who feel similarly.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>With these in mind, I'm excited to embark on yet another
                    antiquated and time consuming hobby - and hopefully connect
                    with people, in this new-old-fashioned-way.</p>
                <h2>So what's next?</h2>
                <p>I owe a lot of time researching forums and how-to's on web development.
                    You might say I'm flying the plane as I'm building it - but that's how I roll -
                    I learn by doing. I intend to maintain this site throughout the remainder of
                    my life - my only regret being that I wish I'd started it sooner.</p>

                <p> tuned for more blog musings, projects I'm working on, habits I've picked up,
                    and general updates on my life, which includes my new wife and our two pets.</p>

                <h2>If you've made it this far…</h2>
                <p>We're off to a great start, and I hope you have found this place worth your time.</p>
