      <h1>So, what am I up to right now?</h1>
      <hr class="hr" />
      <p>Right now, I'm learning HTML / CSS to build this website. That's right! No wordpress, squarespace, or any other
        'easy way' for me.</p>
      <p>Why? Two reasons.</p>
      <p>1. It's antiquated, less convenient, and less practical. You'll notice a similar theme throughout my
        many interests.
        There's a certain minimum suffering I must endure. For me, joy comes from learning, doing and creating.</p>
      <p>The world will always try to sell you a solution - don't fall for it.</p>
      <p>2. The internet has become an odious, vile and depressing place. The
        algorithms have me down, and I'm losing all interest
        in social media beyond my professional obligations. Furthermore, as
        a marketer, I'm deeply disturbed by the latest trends in web development (and other negative externalities of
        capitalism, which will be a future
        blog post). They are slow, bulky, and unecessary. HTML (with light CSS for visual clarity), on the other hand,
        is lightning fast, lightweight, and still the gold
        standard.
      <p>Did you notice how fast this site loaded?</p>
      </p>
      <h2> What else?</h2>
      <hr class="hr1" />
      <p>As you may know, my wife and I got officially married on October 25, 2025. Hooray!</p>
      <p>But that's not why you're here.</p>
      <p>You're here to learn about my hobbies.</p>
      <p>Right now, these are golfing, web development (hi), and home improvement. There are many other varied interests
        and projects
        I'm working on, however. See projects for more. </p>
